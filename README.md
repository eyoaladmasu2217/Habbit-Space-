# Habit Space

Habit Space is a modern, interactive habit tracker built with React Native and Expo. It features a unique "Space" concept where each habit has its own dedicated, zoomable dashboard for tracking progress.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive Zoomable UI**: Each habit is a card that you can "zoom into" using pinch gestures or tapping.
- **Daily Check-ins**: Easily track your daily progress with a single tap.
- **Customizable Habits**: Add habits with personalized titles, icons, and colors.
- **Persistence**: Your data is saved locally on your device using AsyncStorage.
- **Fluid Animations**: Smooth transitions and gestures powered by React Native Reanimated.
- **Dark Mode UI**: A sleek, dark-themed interface designed for focus.
